PHP Framework - Methodology (A Different Approach)

A Different Way to think about PHP Frameworks

phin_Framework is NOT a complete framework like Codeigniter or others.  
Instead, it contains the essential parts to allow developers to adapt it to there projects or specific needs quickly
and cleanly.  I takes very little from common frameworks and focus' on being used to create any web app without out of
the box contraints.
Some may even consider this more of a Methodology rather than a Framework, but whatever you call it, it allows quick, 
customizable web app development.

Getting Started
===============

To get started, simply upload the phin_Framwork files to you local or remote server and go to the directory
you installed it in in a web browser.
**NOTE - Since the _system/config.php does not exist by default, we will create it.  The app looks for
_system/config.php file and if does not exist (and on a fresh install it should not), the app will redirect
you to the installation page automatically.
